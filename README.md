Test Sandbox
------------

You can try it live on our server demo instance: http://54.228.25.31/


Server
======

Get and run last binary
-----------------------

```
wget https://drone.io/github.com/jvermillard/leshan/files/leshan.jar
java -jar ./leshan.jar
```

Compile & Run
-------------

```
mvn install
cd leshan-standalone
mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
```

Run:

```
java -jar target/leshan-standalone-*-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
```

Connect on Leshan UI: http://localhost:8080

Leshan provides a very simple UI to get the list of connected clients and interact with clients resources.

Now you can register your LWM2M client using:

[Eclipse Wakaama](http://eclipse.org/wakaama) or its lua binding [lualwm2m] (https://github.com/sbernard31/lualwm2m).

Leshan-client library or use the example LeshanDevice.  To build the LeshanDevice example, first compile the leshan-client:

```
mvn install
cd leshan-client-standalone
mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
```

Then run, setting first the hostname and port the client should use (i.e., something that isn't either 5683 or 5684 if both the server and client are running on the same machine) followed by the hostname and port of the server:

```
java -jar target/leshan-client-*-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar localhost 9000 localhost 5683
```

The list of the registered clients: http://localhost:8080/api/clients

Code with eclipse
-----------------
You need to add the M2_REPO to your java classpath variables. To do that you can execute the following command:

```
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo
```
An eclipse restart is needed (if you already have it open).

You can also do that inside eclipse: From the menu bar, select Window > Preferences. Select the *Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables* page.

Now, you need to eclipsify leshan java projects,so run:

```
mvn eclipse:eclipse
```
We advise you to activate *Format source code* and *Organized imports* on *Save Actions*.
